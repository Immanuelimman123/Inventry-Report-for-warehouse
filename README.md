## Usage Workflow

1. **Manage Products:**  
   Add new products with a unique ID, name, and quantity. Update or delete existing products.

2. **Manage Locations:**  
   Define warehouse/storage locations with unique IDs and names. Edit or delete locations as needed.

3. **Record Movements:**  
   Add product movements by specifying product, quantity, source location (optional if incoming), and destination location (optional if outgoing).

4. **View Inventory Report:**  
   Automatically calculate real-time stock balances per product and location, considering initial stock and all movements.

5. **Edit & Delete Operations:**  
   Easily update or remove products, locations, and movement records. Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions.
